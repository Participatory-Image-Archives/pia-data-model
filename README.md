# PIA Data Model
Data model for the _Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives_ (PIA) project. This repository is tied to the user stories and use cases listed on https://github.com/Participatory-Image-Archives/pia-stories. 

This repository is structured in the following manner: 
- `data-curation`: curated extracts of the SGV (_Schweizerische Gesellschaft f√ºr Volkskunde_) metadata
- `dbml model`: logical structure of the PIA database and SQL extract
- `iiif`: IIIF Manifest boilerplates, architecture overview and scripts to create IIIF-compliant resources
- `ontology`: current SGV ontology and RDF Data Model (in progress - not yet available)
- `salsah-export`: metadata extracted from https://salsah.org. All resource types' metadata from the SGV have been extracted, except for Images where only two collections relevant to the PIA project are available. In most folders can be found two XML files (unresolved and resolved properties) as well as a CSV file.

## Data Model Diagrams and Flowcharts

We use Miro to create diagrams and flowcharts. Here are some work-in-progress designs that can be viewed:
